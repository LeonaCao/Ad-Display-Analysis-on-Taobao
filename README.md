# Ad-Display-Analysis-on-Taobao

This is a project that I completed with my teammates when taking the Web Analytics course in Business Analytics and Project Management Program at UConn.

In this project, we conducted causality analysis upon datasets about ad displays / click logs of 1.14 million users on Taobao for 8 days (source: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/ad-displayclick-data-on-taobaocom?select=ad_feature.csv). By creating a key metric CTR (Click Through Rate), we were able to identify whether an ad display was effective and study which feature variables from the user profiles were the most significant to the CTR. Finally, we constructed an experiment based on the analysis results to facilitate the ad displays on Taobao.
